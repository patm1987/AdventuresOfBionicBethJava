# Adventures of Bionic Beth

## Game Design
Simple 2.5D platformer.

### Game Play
Simple 2D collect-a-thon platformer. Ideally multiple paths through the level. One may collect hats dropped throughout the level generating a score.

Primary weapon is a large sledge hammer. You may attack with a heavy attack (swing the hammer over your head) or a quick forward jab. When in the air, you may stab it upwards, jab it forwards, or hold it below you to strike/bounce off of an enemy on the ground.

### Look and Feel
The current plan is for 3D world geometry with 2D sprites.

Character sprites will be collage-esqe. Ideally actual cutouts from magazines and assembled.

### Cast of Characters
Bionic Beth - the hero. She a cyborg wielding a sledgehammer.

Pat in Peril - captured by the evil haberdashasauruses, he must be rescued

Sir Haberdashasaurus - A very dapper leader of the velociraptor pack. Adorned with a twirly mustache, tophat, and monocle.

The Haberdashasauruses - a remaining collection the haberdashasauruses
